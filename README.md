### 👋 Hi, I'm Laukik

**MS CS @ UMass Amherst**  
I build **systems**, **models**, and occasionally **good code**.

🔧 **What I love working on**  
- Agentic AI pipelines + LLM reasoning systems
- Distributed systems & databases (Dynamo-style KV, consistency models)  
- Real-time telemetry, full-stack apps, and Web3 integrations
- Deep Reinforcement Learning for robotics & navigation  

💡 **If it's complex, I probably enjoy building it.**

### 🧠 Current Work
- 🧩 Emotional reasoning dataset pipeline (EmoBench-inspired)  
- ⚡ Distributed KV Store with quorum consistency & commit logs  
- 📈 Real-time cross-platform telemetry dashboard (C# + Avalonia)
- 🤖 DRL-based UGV path planning (TD3, DQN variants)
